# Build Notes

AnimusForge now publishes one `Modules\AnimusForge` module with a Bootstrap and two version-specific implementation DLLs.

## Quick Build

Run `一键编译覆盖推送\一键编译.bat` to build both implementations plus Bootstrap and assemble a complete project-local module at `bin\Debug\single_module_stage\AnimusForge`. It does not write to the game directory.

For the repository's complete compile-only pipeline, which never deploys without `-Deploy`:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\一键编译覆盖推送\build_single_module.ps1 `
  -ProjectRoot . `
  -BannerlordRoot "F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Mount & Blade II Bannerlord" `
  -Bannerlord14ReferenceDir ".\.tmp\build_check\1.4" `
  -Configuration Debug `
  -Stage
```

Direct project checks are available for the current 1.4 implementation and Bootstrap:

```powershell
dotnet build AnimusForge.csproj -c Debug /p:BannerlordApi=1.4
dotnet build src\AF.Bootstrap\AnimusForge.Bootstrap.csproj -c Debug
```

The 1.3 implementation intentionally fails closed when built directly. Use `build_single_module.ps1`; it verifies that the pinned reference overlay reports a 1.3.x `BuildInfo` before enabling the 1.3 compile. If the installed game is currently on 1.3.x, pass `-Bannerlord14ReferenceDir` (or keep the repository's verified `.tmp\build_check\1.4` overlay) so the 1.4 implementation does not mix 1.3 assemblies into its build.

The unified build script uses isolated output/intermediate directories, validates the 1.3 and 1.4 reference lines, records the exact reference game version in each `build.json`, and keeps only DLL/PDB/build metadata artifacts.

The build resolves `0Harmony.dll` independently from the installed/Workshop `Bannerlord.Harmony` module. AnimusForge's private ONNX/System runtime DLLs are resolved as one validated set from either `AnimusForge\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client` in the source tree or the existing unified game module. The resolved runtime directory is passed through to staging/deployment; `0Harmony.dll` is not duplicated in the AnimusForge module because `SubModule.xml` depends on `Bannerlord.Harmony`.

## Runtime Layout

```text
Modules\AnimusForge\bin\Win64_Shipping_Client\
├─ AnimusForge.Bootstrap.dll
├─ AnimusForge.Bootstrap.pdb
├─ AnimusForge.Bootstrap.build.json
├─ private runtime dependencies
└─ versions\
   ├─ 1.3\AnimusForge.dll + PDB + build.json
   └─ 1.4\AnimusForge.dll + PDB + build.json
```

`SubModule.xml` loads only `AnimusForge.Bootstrap.dll`. The Bootstrap detects the game version and loads exactly one implementation.

## Optional MSBuild Properties

- `BannerlordApi=1.3|1.4` (`1.3` is enabled only by the verified unified build script)
- `Configuration=Debug|Release`
- `VersionedDepsDir=<1.3 dependency directory>`
- `Bannerlord13ReferenceDir=<verified 1.3 reference overlay>` (unified build script)
- `Bannerlord14ReferenceDir=<verified 1.4 reference overlay>` (unified build script; required when the installed game is not 1.4.x)
- `BannerlordRoot=<Bannerlord root>`
- `AnimusForgeBinDir=<runtime dependency directory>`
- `RuntimeDependencyDir=<complete AnimusForge private runtime dependency directory>` (unified build/deploy scripts)
- `HarmonyCorePath=<full path to 0Harmony.dll>` (normally auto-resolved from Bannerlord.Harmony)
- `Mcmv5Path=<full path to MCMv5.dll>`

Deployment stages and validates a complete module beside `Modules\AnimusForge`, then swaps directories on the same volume and restores the old module if replacement fails. On the first unified deployment only, legacy module `PlayerExports` are read as migration candidates; legacy module folders are never modified or deleted.

Build-only commands never deploy. Only `一键编译并覆盖.bat` and `一键覆盖.bat` write `Modules\AnimusForge`. `一键编译.bat` and the packaging BAT use the project-local staged module; the development pull/build/push BAT files also do not deploy.
